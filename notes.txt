WebSynth

Browser-based synthesizer

Goals:
  Modularity and flexibility
  A friction-minimal UI that rewards spontaneity and creativity
    - Hotkey-drive synth adjustments
      - Hotkey chords
        (maybe need an abstraction/helper function to help create chord event handlers?)

Next:
  - Add support for mono/poly
    - Polyphony button toggles Poly Mode
      - Poly depends on Voices
        - A voice is almost the entire synthesizer to this point
        - Notes are started by creating new sets of oscillators, not simply adjusting old ones' volumes
        - Notes are ended by destroying/releasing old sets of oscillators
  - Mono default legato w/trill (done with room for cleaner refactor)
  - Add velocity sensitivity
    - With slider
