WebSynth

Browser-based synthesizer

Goals:
  Modularity and flexibility
  A friction-minimal UI that rewards spontaneity and creativity
    - Hotkey-drive synth adjustments
      - Hotkey chords
        (maybe need an abstraction/helper function to help create chord event handlers?)

Next:
  - Add support for mono/poly
  - Mono default legato w/trill
  - Add velocity sensitivity
    - With slider
