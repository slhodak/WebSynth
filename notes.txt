WebSynth

Browser-based synthesizer

Goals:
  Modularity and flexibility
  A friction-minimal UI that rewards spontaneity and creativity
    - Hotkey-drive synth adjustments
      - Hotkey chords
        (maybe need an abstraction/helper function to help create chord event handlers?)

Next:
  - Add support for mono/poly
    - Polyphony button toggles Poly Mode
      - Poly depends on Voices
        - A voice is almost the entire synthesizer to this point
        - Notes are started by creating new sets of oscillators, not simply adjusting old ones' volumes
        - Notes are ended by destroying/releasing old sets of oscillators
  - Mono default legato w/trill (done with room for cleaner refactor)
  - Add velocity sensitivity
    - With slider

  -Voices
    - Oscillators from Synthesizer (archetypes) all cloned
    OR
    - Oscillators sending multiple streams of audio... not possible
    
    - Oscillators created on noteOn from synth archetypes
      - wow sounds like an expensive operation. Deep cloning? Latency?
        - Deep cloning actually not desired?
      - Oscillators all must be separate OscillatorNodes but refer to the same MasterGain


Troubleshooting:
  - Voice buildup
    1) hitting keyboard
    2) note on message creating new voice in synth.playnote
    3) voice added to synth voices
    3a) voice creates gain node as own gain, connects to master gain
    4) voice creates shallow copies of oscillators, adds to own oscillators array
    5) voice alters oscillators with frequency determined by note from new message
    6) shallow osc copies disconnected from context master gain
    7) shallow osc copies connected to voice gain
    8) original oscillators are being turned on, then copied, not copied, rerouted, and then turned on. hm.
    --- The real problem was probably just that velocity was being calculated upside down (127 / 5 is really loud!)


  - the voice is basically just a gain node that creates oscillators with different frequencies and connects them to itself

  - Voices not creating new oscillator nodes?
  
  TODO: 
    - Fix disconnect timing (done but investigate a debouncer or something)
    - Re-implement legato alongside poly option (did)
    - Connect oscillator voices to filter (done)

Next:
  - Moving iterating controller setting functions to iterating synthesizer setting functions


Rules:
  - Changes to the list of oscillators won't take effect until a new note is voiced (todo)
