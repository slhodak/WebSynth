# WebSynth

## Description

A browser-based subtractive synthesizer. 

**In this document**  
Hotkey actions are given in italicized brackets (like: _\[o\]_) when mentioned.

## Usage

Create arbitrary numbers of oscillator _\[o\]_ and filter _\[f\]_ nodes.

A routing table appears when the first node has been created.

Route a node's output by clicking from a source node (left column of routing table) to a destination node (any other column on routing table). Eligible destinations are given in blue, the source's current destination is green, and ineligible routes are red.

Saved presets can be named, and new saves with the same name will overwrite old saves.
